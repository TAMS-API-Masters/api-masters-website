Hello there, and welcome to **API Masters** (the best committee at TAMS; believe us, we've run a machine learning algorithm on it and, well, those are never wrong). This website was created for multiple reasons: 

1. To serve as a repository of important links.
2. To update everyone with cool API Masters/general news.
3. To show that you can still make a modern website with a woody background.

Trust us, we're very ambitious, and this website is just one facet in an dense network of plans to eventually absorb all other clubs, including CSO.

We look forward to learning, yearning and churning with you (by learning, we mean learning cool APIs; by yearning, we mean yearning for computer science excellence; by churning, we mean...uh... well, it rhymed). 

Sincerely, **Nathaniel and Sridhar**, your API Masters 2020-2021
